Web-interface for displaying sensor data for my photovoltaic wireless-sensor
project.[1](http://mon.sedio.org/)

## Overview

1. Retrieve sensor-data with HTTP GET using the URI hierarchical path. 
2. Use JavaScript Object Notation(JSON) as the data-interchange format.
3. Ability to use charts as a graphical representation for data.

## To do

* Finish the _readserial.py_ code which is responsible for getting the data from
  the transmitting format, and storing it in the database. 
* Add the ability to view charts real-time.
* Add the ability to filter search "from-date -- to-date". The current implementation
  supports "on-date".
